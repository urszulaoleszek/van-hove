# van-hove
van-hove is a result of a team student project *"Van Hove singularities of surface states in crystalline topological insulator"*, led on [Faculty of Physics](https://www.fuw.edu.pl/faculty-of-physics-home.html), University of Warsaw.  

## Introduction
*In our physical model we considered a 2 dimensional twisted graphene lattice,
trapped in parabolic potential. In such systems one can observe Van Hove
singularities. They are caused by reaching infinite values by the density of
states function in several points on the lattice. These points refer to the saddle
points of the potential.
Our goal was to evaluate eigenstates and eigenvalues in neighbourhood of
the saddle points. We did this in two independent ways – theoretical and
numerical. For numerical calculations we have used [Kwant](https://kwant-project.org/) framework. At the end we compared the obtained results for the particular
Hamiltonian.*
